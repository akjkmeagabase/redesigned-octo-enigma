### [What is Web3.Storage?](#what-is-web3storage)

Web3.Storage is a service to make building on top of Filecoin as simple as possible - giving the developers the power of open, distributed networks via a friendly JS client library. Behind the scenes, Web3.Storage uses Filecoin for storage and advertises content via IPFS leveraging the unique properties of each network.

Filecoin offers persistent, decentralized storage - guaranteeing the integrity of the underlying data through a robust economic model while also providing cryptographic proofs for verifiability.
IPFS offers content addressing - enabling developers to create immutable links to their content, and flexibility for developers in how they'd like to retrieve their data (whether it be running personal nodes, relying on public infrastructure, or paying for hosted options).

Developers can start building in a matter of minutes - allowing them to take advantage of all the power and openness of the decentralized web with none of the infrastructure complexity.
### [Methodology](#methodology)

Content uploaded to Web3.Storage is pinned redundantly in an [IPFS Cluster](https://cluster.ipfs.io/) of 3 geographically distributed nodes. When 32GiB of content is made available, a request is made to pin a new batch of content into a separate IPFS cluster - where a 32GiB [CAR file](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv2/#summary) is generated to store the data. Once this 32GiB CAR file is ready, a queue of geographically distributed miners - selected for performance and availability - bid for the right to store these deals, with the Web3.Storage client making a minimum of 5 deals with the various miners. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.web3.storage) for how one can use the [Status API](https://docs.web3.storage/how-tos/query/) to query for information regarding pin status and deal status for your uploaded content.

Once the deals are active, the Web3.Storage client polls to ensure that the relevant sectors are still available. In the event of an early termination (or a miner going offline), the Web3.Storage client will automatically add the relevant deals into the queue of upcoming deals to ensure at all times there are always a minimum of 5 copies of data being stored with Filecoin Miners.

In the future, we hope to expand this service to offer a variety of options for storing data - including purely protocol based approaches (e.g. via smart contracts) as well as other hosted options (e.g. HTTP end points). We also aim to provide more native tooling for automated deal management via tools like Data DAOs - which may augment the offerings of this service in the future. Our aim today is to provide a user friendly experience that massively reduces the burden for onboarding new use cases into the web3 ecosystem today - while providing an upgrade path for the future.
### [Storage Term and Data Limits](#storage-term-and-data-limits)

Web3.Storage supports uploads up to 32GiB in size per request, and currently has a cap of 1TiB of storage per account. Data limits can be increased at no cost by submitting a request [here](/mailto:support@web3.storage). Data stored via Web3.Storage will be stored at no cost to the user on IPFS indefinitely for as long as Protocol Labs, Inc. continues to operate the service, and stored Filecoin until the expiry of the respective deals (see below for details).

Protocol Labs, Inc. reserves the right to terminate Web3.Storage at its sole discretion or to transfer management of deals to a third party or smart contract.

Prior to termination, Protocol Labs will provide 90 days notice to users via email to allow users enough time to make arrangements (e.g. pinning to their own IPFS node, or preparing to manage the renewal of their Filecoin deals on their own).

### [Filecoin deals](#filecoin-deals)

Data stored in Web3.Storage is guaranteed to be available in IPFS upon completion of a successful upload. Please note that once replication in IPFS is complete (at a minimum of 3 copies being stored), data is also pushed to be stored on Filecoin. Given content is batched into deals on Filecoin, it is expected that there may be a delay between the content being uploaded to the service and eventually making it into a deal on Filecoin. You may query the status of any CID uploaded through Web3.Storage using the [Status API](https://docs.web3.storage/how-tos/query/) (updated every five minutes) for the latest information regarding an individual CID's pin status or deal status.

For reference, the following parameters and strategies are used to ensure highly redundant storage on the Filecoin network:

- Deals with miners are set to last 18 months with deal renewals being automatically managed by Web3.Storage.
- Each piece of content is stored with a minimum of 5 miners, typically exceeding this minimum (the specific list of miners being provided via the [Status API](https://docs.web3.storage/how-tos/query/)).
- In the event of a [terminated sector](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_mining/sector/lifecycle/), [Web3.Storage](http://web3.storage) will automatically store an additional copy to meet the minimum of 5 copies being stored on the Filecoin network.

It is recommended that you do not rely on Filecoin deals directly for performant retrieval, and instead retrieve the data via IPFS (where [Web3.Storage](http://web3.Storage) will be dual pinning the content). Retrieving data over the IPFS network is the recommended means of accessing Web3.Storage data.
